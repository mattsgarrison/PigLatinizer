Pig Latinizer
=============

Create a simple Rails app that accepts arbitrary user input, persists it, and then provides a 'Pig Latin' translation on an HTML view.

Instructions
============

Fork this repo, complete the task and send your completed work back to this repository as a pull request.

In the problem scope I have provided, there are issues I have intentionally not provided instructions for.  Anything you encounter that would need feedback from me, file as a Github Issue on this repository and continue.  I won't actually be answering any issues, I just want them as artifacts of your work, so fulfill 'the spirit of the question' as best as possible and make any assumptions you want about the answers to any questions you have.

Do not spend an excessive amount of time on this, but try to complete it in one sitting.

#### Rules of Pig Latin


1) If the word begins with a consonant, move the consonant to the end of the word and append the letters 'ay'.

2) If the word begins with a vowel, append the letters 'ay' to the word.
